# Run & Route Hub

Run & Route Hub is a running-focused web application designed for UH Mānoa students.  
The app helps runners:

- Find running partners based on pace and availability
- Access safe & UH-verified running routes
- Log runs and track personal progress
- View route difficulty scores (heat, slope, humidity, distance)
- Share safety feedback (lighting, crowds, sidewalks, water fountains)

This project is built on the ICS Software Engineering **Next.js Application Template**, and follows the standard development workflow using GitHub Projects, Issues, Branching, and Vercel deployment.
